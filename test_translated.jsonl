(5) At the same time, the Director General clarified that the number of pilots who have gone on vacation will only grow. (6) At the moment, 8 Airbus 320 airliners have already been taken out of service. (7) It is assumed that in the near future they will add 4 or 5 more aircraft. (8) ) In total, the carrier's fleet has 66 A320 airliners, which make up 65 percent of the total number of Aeroflot aircraft. (9) According to the newspaper, the airline's net loss due to the withdrawal of part of the aircraft may amount to about $ 10 million, lost profits - $ 30 million in. (10) It is assumed that Aeroflot will resume all flights by the New Year holidays. (11) Pilots are currently allowed to fly no more than 800 hours per year.

(3) It is difficult to imagine cosmonauts flying in a spacecraft through outer space, deliberately destroying a complex and delicate life support system designed for a long flight. (4) But gradually, consistently, with amazing irresponsibility, we put this life support system out of action, poisoning rivers, cutting down forests, spoiling the World Ocean.

(12) They scurry about, multiply, do their job, eating up the bowels, depleting the fertility of the soil, poisoning rivers and oceans with their poisonous substances, the very atmosphere of the Earth. (13) Unfortunately, such concepts as silence, the possibility of solitude and intimate communication of a person with nature, with the beauty of our land, are just as vulnerable as the biosphere, just as defenseless against the pressure of so-called technical progress. (14) On the one hand, a person, twitched by the inhuman rhythm of modern life, crowding, a huge flow of artificial information, weaned himself off spiritual communication with the outside world, on the other hand, this outside world itself is brought into such a state that sometimes it does not invite a person to spiritual communication with him. (15) It is not known how this original disease, called humanity, will end for the planet. (16) Will the Earth have time to develop some kind of antidote? (According to V.

(5) I walked along the shore, not thinking about anything, admiring a truly extraordinary sight. (6) Never, with the most amicable melting of the deepest snows, has there been such a flood on our river, such a water body, as now.

(18) She returned to the alder bush and again began to look at me, rowing tirelessly in one place, keeping on the water two meters from me, which is incredible for this fearful animal. (19) It was heroism, it was the self-sacrifice of the mother, but it could not be otherwise: after all, the cubs screamed so alarmingly and so invitingly!
