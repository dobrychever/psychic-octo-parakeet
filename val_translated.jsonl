{"idx": 33, "passage": {"text": "(1) Ты не забыта мною, моя далекая родина, Сибирь, богатая золотом, дремучими лесами, морозами и дивными явлениями природы! (2) Как первые мечты юности, как любимые игры детства, я помню твои вековые кедры, твои безмолвные пустыни, переломленные веками утесы в ущелиях гор и твою безмерную, голубую, как глаза сибирской девы, светлую, как глыба льду, Ангару, на берегах которой беспечно, весело и быстро пролетели дни детства моего. (3) Сибирь! (4) Как далека ты и как близка к душе моей! (5) Всё, что впечатлевалось некогда в юную память мою, все помню я, даже гул ветра по сосновым лесам, когда, переходя с мшистых тундр, в твоих дебрях гуляет он, мощный сын Ледовитого моря, и разносит туманы, и природы, и страсти, которые облегают здесь, на Руси, небосклон, и тускнят в глазах моих и великолепные здания, и бархатные луга, и цветущие поля, согреваемые солнцем, распещряемые радугами цветов и пожираемые завистливым человеком. (6) Смотря ли на здешние обнаженные поля, забыть мне твои необозримые, нетронутые степи, Сибирь — золотое дно! (7) Простите воспоминаниям былого, друзья мои! (8) Дивитесь странностям человеческого сердца: я многое видел с тех пор, как в последний раз с надеждами, с мечтами на будущее — еще юный, еще полный жизни — глядел на Иркутск, над которым великолепно восходило солнце и золотило лучами своими синие воды Ангары и зеленые берега Иркута.. (9) Много времени минуло тому; много испытала душа моя и горя, и радости; много тех, с которыми делилась она, совершили навсегда путь жизни и отдыхают под гробовым дерном.. (10) Но где я ни был — и на вершинах Урала, и вблизи Кавказа и Тавриды, и на берегах Азовского моря, и на выстланных гранитом берегах Балтийского моря, и на роскошных пажитях Украины — нигде, нет, нигде уже не волновалась так душа моя, не билось так сильно сердце мое, не горела так пламенно голова моя, как там, в дикой моей родине! (11) Это был мир очарований, мир, пролетевший сном мгновенным. (12) Если кто из вас, друзья мои, будет в Иркутске — пусть пойдет он за город, к тому месту, где близ старой, разрушенной мельницы вливается в Ангару Ушаковка. (13) Тут извивистое течение этой речки приведет его к тому месту, где Ушаковка раздвояется островами, где против него на луговой стороне будет старое Адмиралтейство — тут жил отец мой; тут были пределы первого моего мира; тут мечтал я, плакивал за Плутархом, думал быть великим человеком, подобно великим людям, им описанным; горделиво расхаживал по лугу, уединяясь в тень дерев, вдохновляясь первою любовью, делясь первыми ощущениями дружбы.. (14) Там, говорят, все изменилось: старый отцовский дом не существует; добрых людей, которые некогда собирались в нем, разнесла буря жизни, и меня — беспечного юношу — увела судьба далеко от родины.. (15) И теперь ещё малолюдна Сибирь, и теперь еще дики леса её; но прежде была она ещё малолюднее, леса её были ещё диче. (16) Было время, что воевода, посланный из Москвы, два года ехал до Иркутска, отдыхая в уединённых острогах и зимовьях от дороги бесконечной. (17) Теперь всюду видите уже следы человека: леса прорублены, болота устланы мостами, горы обрыты. (18) Часто едете и ныне не встречая живого существа человеческого; но тут же видите, что человек был уже в сих местах, срубил, срыл, замостил и удалился. (19) Прежде вы напрасно искали бы его. (По Н.

(2) Music opens people's eyes to the beauty of nature, moral relations, labor. (3) Thanks to music in a person the idea of ​​the sublime, majestic, beautiful not only in the world around us, but also in ourselves is awakening. (4) On winter days, when all our paths were covered with snow, we sat in the school room, listening to the melodies of P. Tchaikovsky, E. Grieg, F. Schubert, R. Schumann. (5) If in early childhood the beauty of a musical work is conveyed to the heart, if in the sounds a child feels the multifaceted shades of human feelings, he will rise to a level of culture that cannot be achieved by any other means. (6 ) By developing a child's sensitivity to music, we ennoble his thoughts, aspirations. (7) The task is for the musical melody to open in every heart a life-giving source of human feelings. (8) But melody - this language of human feelings - conveys to the child's soul not only the beauty of the world: it reveals human greatness and dignity to people. (9) The spontaneous, disorganized influence of music on children does not contribute to, but rather harms, the correct aesthetic education: the child becomes a hostage of musical noise, he is suppressed by a pile of sounds, he is not able to distinguish beauty from ugliness. (10) So he will go into the world, confused, unsure of himself. (11) You can't just put a child down and make him listen to music, no, the child must have a Teacher who will help him in musical education. (12) I chose melodies for listening, in which, in vivid images, understandable to children, the sounds that they hear around them are conveyed: the charming chirping of birds, the rustling of leaves, the rumble of thunder, the murmur of a stream, the howling of the wind. (13) I used no more than two melodies a month, but before getting to know each melody I did a lot of educational work, the purpose of which was to awaken the desire in children to listen to music again and again, to ensure that every time the guys discovered a new beauty in the work. (14) In early autumn, when every sound is clearly heard in the transparent air, I suggested listening to the melody \"Flight of the Bumblebee\" from the opera \"The Tale of Tsar Saltan\" by N. Rimsky-Korsakov. (15) Music found an emotional response in children. (16) The kids said: (17) “The bumblebee is approaching and moving away.

(3) The need for creativity is as natural as the need to drink or eat; it glimmers in each of us, even in the most incredibly difficult conditions. (4) Each person is talented and unique in his own way. (5) Fortunately, people who are absolutely bad internally and externally do not exist. (6) The fact that the need for creativity is inherent in everyone is evident at least from the fact that in childhood, even in infancy, the child has a need for play. (7) Every child wants to play, that is, to live creatively. (8) Why, over the years, creativity gradually disappears from our life, why does the creative principle persist and develop not in each of us? (9) Roughly speaking, because we either did not do our own thing (did not find ourselves, our face, our talent), or did not learn to live and work (did not develop talent). (10) The second often depends on the first, but the first is not always free from the second either. (11) If you do not learn to work, you will not know what nature has rewarded you with. (12) If the spiritual potential is weak, then the personality is erased, leveled, quickly loses individual, inherent in it one feature. (13) Any mental, family, social or world discord, any disorder, which, by the way, can be different, can hinder a slender ascent, creative emancipation of the individual. (14) For example, it's one thing when there are no shoes to go to school (or even the school itself), and quite another when you are forced to comprehend musical literacy. (15) Of course, the second case is preferable, but discord is discord. (16) Therefore, we see that social orientation is by no means always infallible and that fashion is generally harmful in such a matter as finding oneself.

(4) More precisely, wisdom must be taught - as caution in judgments, refraining from insufficiently substantiated statements, the ability to take into account many factors, relying on what is born of a variety of historical experience. (5) It is more than knowledge. (b) It is also intuition and aversion to self-deception. (7) A wise person is never presumptuous: he does not consider the results of thought obtained by him to be final, he admits their error, comparing them with directly opposite statements and finding gaps in what seemed indisputable. (8) Wisdom needs knowledge, but is not limited to it. (9) Someone may know, say, all types of butterflies and not understand anything about environmental problems. (10) Don't even be interested in them. (11) In this case, a person loses sight of the connection of a single butterfly with the structure of the world. (12) Knowledge answers the question “Why?”, And information - only the questions “What? Where? When? How?\". (13) Knowledge consists of \"understandings\" and is the property of science. (14) Knowledge needs information, but it is not limited to it - it is higher, because it knows how to check the accuracy of information. (15) Knowledge in the European and now in the worldwide scientific tradition has always opposed opinion. (16) Opinion is just some relation to something, and knowledge is, I repeat, an understanding of a pattern. (17) It is important not so much to defend your opinion without fail, as to think about it being proven, even if it strives to become knowledge. (18) The desire to encourage unfounded opinions in every possible way as an end in itself is very dangerous for a growing person. (19) It is not enough to think on your own - you still need to think correctly.
