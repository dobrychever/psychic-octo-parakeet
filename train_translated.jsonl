(5) That morning at dawn, he burned the gloves and garters of his former lovers, and from this sacrificial fire he asked heaven for only one treasure - Belinda's lock. (6) Faithful Ariel, anticipating danger, gathered all the host of good spirits under his control and turned to them with an appeal to protect and take care of the beauty. (7) He reminds sylphs, sylphs, elves and fairies how important and responsible their work is and how many dangers are fraught with every moment. (8) “Whether shame touches innocence, whether porcelain turns out to be cracked, honor suffers, or brocade, suddenly a nymph loses a bracelet or a heart at the ball in the heat of the moment ...” (9) Ariel entrusts every spirit with the care of one item of Belinda's dress - earrings, fan, watch, curls. (10) He himself undertakes to keep an eye on the dog of the beauty named Shock. (11) Fifty sylphs are attached to the skirt - this \"silver line\" of purity.

(2) And this stock of old girls of this kind is so inexhaustible that, despite the fact that there are many chosen ones, there is still a lot of love that they pour out on everyone around, on all good and evil people, who only encounter them in life. (3) There are three kinds of love: beautiful love, selfless love and active love. (4) I'm talking about love for a person, which, depending on the greater or lesser strength of the soul, focuses on one thing, on some or poured out on many. (5) About love for a mother, for a father, for a brother, for children, for a comrade, for a friend, for a compatriot, about love for a person. (6) Beautiful love lies in love for the beauty of the feeling itself and his expressions. (7) People who loving t with beautiful love, they care very little about reciprocity as a circumstance that has no effect on the beauty and pleasantness of feeling. (8) They often change the objects of their love, since their main goal is only to make the pleasant feeling of love constantly aroused (9) In order to maintain this pleasant feeling in themselves, they constantly speak in the most graceful expressions about their love both for the object itself and for all those who do not even care about this love. (10) For people who they love so much, the beloved object is so kind as it excites that pleasant feeling, the consciousness and expression of which they enjoy.(11) The second kind of love is selfless love, it consists in love for the process of sacrificing oneself for a beloved object, while not paying attention to whether these sacrifices are worse or better for the beloved object. (12) People who love this way never believe reciprocity. (13) They do not care whether you ate well, slept well, whether you have fun, whether you are healthy, and they will not do anything to provide you with these comforts if they are in their power. (14) But stand under bullet, throw themselves into the water, into the fire, wither away from love - they are always ready for this, if only an opportunity occurs. (15) In addition, people inclined to selfless love are always proud of their love, exacting, jealous, distrustful and, strange to say, they wish their objects dangers in order to rid them of them, misfortunes, to comfort them, and even vices in order to correct them. (16) The third kind is active love, it consists in the desire to satisfy all needs, all desires, whims, even vices of a loved one. (17) People who love so, love but all their life. (18) Their love is rarely expressed in words, and if it is expressed, then not only is it smug, beautiful, but also bashful, awkward, because they are always afraid that they do not love enough ... (19) And this is something active love for my nephew, niece, sister shone in the eyes, in every word and movement of Sofya Ivanovna. (20) Only years later I fully appreciated Sofya Ivanovna, but even then the question came to my mind: why Dmitry, who tried to understand love in a completely different way than usually young people, and who always had before his eyes the sweet, loving Sophia Ivanovna, suddenly fell passionately in love with the incomprehensible Lyubov Sergeevna and only admitted that his aunt also had good qualities.

{"idx": 75, "passage": {"text": "(1) One thing is clear to me: the main participants in history are People and Time. (2) Do not forget Time means not forgetting People, not forgetting People means not forgetting Time. (3) The number of divisions that participated in this or in another battle, historians calculate with scrupulous accuracy. (4) However, they will not be able to overhear a conversation in a trench before a tank attack, to see the suffering and tears in the eyes of an eighteen-year-old girl-sanitary instructor dying in the darkness of a dilapidated dugout, around which the bursting German tanks are buzzing, to feel the crack a machine-gun burst that kills life. (5) We were then twenty years old. (6) We dreamed of returning to that sunny pre-war world where the sun seemed to us a festive sun rising above the earth from day to day according to its immutable pattern; the herb was a herb meant to grow; lanterns - in order to illuminate the dry April sidewalk, the evening crowd of walking, in which you are walking too, eighteen, tanned, strong. (7) All the showers merrily passed over your head, and you were mischievously glad to the glint of lightning and cannon rolls of thunder; all the smiles in that time were intended for you, all deaths and tears were strangers ... (8) The whole world, transparently radiant, lay at your feet in early blue April, warming with kindness, joy, waiting for love. (9) There, behind, there was no fierce intransigence, everywhere there was a greenish-light watercolor in the air; and there were no harsh black paints. (10) For the long four years of war, feeling the fiery breath of death near our shoulder, silently passing by fresh bumps with chemical pencil inscriptions on the tablets, we did not lose the old world of youth in ourselves, but we grew up twenty years and, it seemed, lived them in such detail, so richly that these years would be enough for the life of two generations.(11) We learned that the world is both strong and unsteady. (12) We learned that the sun may not rise in the morning, because its brilliance, its warmth can be destroyed by bombing when the horizon sinks in a black-purple curtain of smoke. (13) ) Sometimes we hated the sun - it promised flying weather and, therefore, shoals of Junkers diving into the trenches. (14) We learned that the sun can tenderly warm not only in summer, but also in the most severe January frosts, at the same time indifferent and merciless to reveal with its light in all details the recent picture of the battle, torn apart by direct hits from guns, the bodies of the dead, whom you called by name a minute ago. (15) We recognized the world together with human courage and suffering. (16) Time has already touched our memory: details have faded, the half-forgotten faces of the dead, the smells of trenches torn apart by shells are not so acutely perceptible in the memories, you do not instinctively bend down on the street at the distant sound of a jackhammer, reminiscent of the fight of a large-caliber machine gun. (17) mov does not burst from the throat of an involuntary cry: \"Lie down!\" (18) As usual, you do not look for a place on the corner, near a pharmacy or a department store (a place for a firing position with a wide firing sector), and a child's cry, accidentally heard in the twilight, does not recall the black outlines of broken villages, stove fumes of smoking ruins, charred gardens , crying in the dark. (19) The long-awaited peace (we walked to it for four years) firmly entered our consciousness - a world with the glitter of the morning sun on the pavements, with the rustle of overcrowded trolleybuses in the evenings and a cozy ride of doves on the cornices at dawn.

{"idx": 123, "passage": {"text": "(1) Injustice has been spoken and written about since ancient times - perhaps since the time when humanity in general learned to speak and write. (2) What is injustice is still not clear. (3) It is very difficult to come to an agreement on this issue, since in this case the dispute is being conducted with a sufficient share of interest. (4) Everyone wants to be treated “justly” and complains about “injustice,” but tries to interpret the situation in such a way that the injustice is immediately apparent. (5) And everyone has enough self-importance to judge \"justly\" about the attitude towards other people, and does not at all notice that others are indignant at his supposed \"justice.\" (6) So the problem is distorted by passions and shrouded in prejudice. (7) Whole generations get stuck in these prejudices, and sometimes you notice how the very word \"justice\" evokes a sarcastic smile. (8) From previous generations, mankind inherited the belief that people are equal from birth and, therefore, must be treated in the same way. (9) However, the essence of justice consists precisely in the unequal treatment of unequal people. (10) If people were truly equal, life would be extremely simple and justice would be extremely easy to find. (11) It would only be worthwhile to say: to the same people - the same share, or to all equally. (12) Then justice could be justified arithmetically and created mechanically; and everyone would be happy, because people would become nothing more than identical atoms, a kind of rolling mechanical balls everywhere, which would be similar externally and would have internally the same mental makeup. (13) How naive, how simple, how petty! (14) In fact, people are not equal in body, soul or spirit. (15) They will be born as creatures of different sexes, with different health and strength, with completely different predispositions, gifts, instincts and desires, they belong to a different spiritual level, and with them (by virtue of justice!) (16) This is the basis and the main difficulty of justice: there are an infinite number of people; they are all different; how to make everyone receive according to justice? (17) If people are not the same, then it is necessary to treat them every time according to their living originality - otherwise injustice arises. (18) Thus, justice means precisely inequality: to take care of the child, to help the weak, to condescend to the tired, to look after the sick; show more severity towards the weak-willed, more trust in the honest, more caution towards the chatterbox; honor the hero. (19) Justice is therefore the art of inequality, and it is inherent only in noble souls.

{"idx": 226, "passage": {"text": "(1)С чьей-то лёгкой руки природу русского Севера журналисты называют неброской, неяркой и скромной. (2)Между тем нигде по стране нет таких ярких, таких выразительных, очень контрастных и многозвучных красок, как на Севере России. (3)Красота этих мест обусловлена не одним лишь разнообразием ландшафтов, сочетающих невысокие горы, холмы, долины, распадки, озёра и реки, обрамлённые лесами, лугами, кустарниками; она обусловлена и разнообразными, то и дело сменяющими друг друга пейзажными настроениями. (4)Эта смена происходит порою буквально в считаные секунды, не говоря уже о переменах, связанных с четырьмя временами года. (5)Лесное озеро из густо-синего моментально может преобразиться в серебристо-сиреневое, стоит подуть из леса лёгкому шуточному ветерку. (6)Ржаное поле и берёзовый лес, речное лоно и луговая трава меняют свои цвета в зависимости от силы и направления ветра. (7)Но кроме ветра есть ещё солнце и небо, время дня и ночи, новолуние и полнолуние, тепло и холод. (8)Бесчисленная смена состояний и сочетаний всего этого тотчас отражается на пейзаже, сопровождая его ещё и своеобразием запахов, звуков, а то абсолютной тишиной, какая бывает в предутреннюю пору белой безветренной ночи, либо в зимнюю, тоже совершенно безветренную нехолодную ночь. (9)Вспомним короткие, почти чёрно-белые зимние дни, сопровождаемые, казалось бы, одной графикой: белые поля, чёрные леса и изгороди, серые дома и постройки. (10)Даже в такое время снега имеют свои оттенки, а что говорить о солнечном утре и о морозной вечерней заре!(11)У человека пока нет таких красок, нет и названий многих цветовых состояний закатного или утреннего неба. (12)Сказать, что заря алая (или багровая, или лиловая), значит почти ничего не сказать: заря ежеминутно меняет свои цвета и оттенки, на линии горизонта краски одни, чуть выше совсем другие, и самой границы между зарёй и небом не существует. (13)А каким цветом назовёшь ярко слепящий солнечным блеском зимний наст, в тени голубовато-просвеченный в глубину и серебристый, словно плавящийся под прямыми лучами?(14)Морозное солнце рождает такое же богатство цветовых тонов, как, например, по-весеннему тёплое. (15)Но даже при плотных тучах, особенно перед началом весны, зимний пейзаж неоднороден, снега то синеватые, то с едва заметной желтизной, лесные дали то дымчато-сиреневые, то чуть голубоватые с коричневым цветом более ближнего лозняка, с сизоватой ольхой, с ясной сосновой зеленью и едва уловимой салатной окраской осинок. (16)Такое предвесеннее состояние ассоциируется с умиротворённою тишиной, с запахами снега, древесной плоти, сена, печного дыма. (17)А сколько состояний ночного густо-фиолетового неба с гроздьями звёзд, уходящими в перспективу и бесконечность!(18)Весеннее и летнее небо меняет свои цвета так же быстро, не скупится на оттенки и колориты, щедрость его на краски безгранична, постоянно меняются и зелёные краски леса, и цвет водной глади в озёрах и реках. (19)Вода то светлая, стальная, то голубая, то синяя до чернильной густоты, то вдруг, особенно в тишине первых осенних холодов, становится зеленоватой. (20)Надо быть глухим и слепым или же болезненно увлечённым чем-то отрешённо-своим, чтобы не замечать этих бесконечно меняющихся картин мира. (По В.

(7) An elderly woman, rattling keys, opened the St. George's Cathedral to us, and we entered a cold, real space, bounded high above by a painted dome, and to our right with an iconostasis as high as an eight-storey building? (8) The key keeper remained below, but we climbed a narrow spiral staircase to the choir. (9) Probably, they corresponded to the fourth or even the fifth floor, but there was still a lot of height above them: a good half of the iconostasis, against which we stood, and above the iconostasis there is a dome, and above the dome there is an empty drum, one of it would be enough for a small little church.

(13) And then the silence burst like a pulled string, but only without a tearing string sound, but immediately another live and strong string sounded and instantly filled the entire huge cathedral with sound. (14) A wave of delight splashed in me from heart to eyes and throat. (15) Rachmaninoff's version of the famous chant was taken immediately and with full force. (16) Whether the acoustics of the cathedral contributed to the impression, was it an extraordinary moment itself, an extraordinary emotional mood, but maybe Kozlovsky never sang so beautifully and with inspiration in his life. (17) If it is true that the audience inspires, then what kind of audience was the singer holding now in front of his half-closed eyes? (18) His voice poured golden, dazzling light, and the stones of the cathedral, awakened and revived, resonated to him with every grain of sand. (19) Downstairs, the old woman with the keys was crying and was about to rush at the feet of the singer, but Kozlovsky lifted her up and calmed her down, stroking her shoulder: Nothing, nothing, granny, lock behind us, thank you, we'll go ...

{"idx": 271, "passage": {"text": "(1) Modern society is concerned that language has begun to change. (2) The expansion of written language is especially noticeable, which displaces oral speech from different spheres. (H) If earlier we communicated, spoke primarily orally, and written speech nevertheless served to store, to transmit information at a distance, after a while, then today written speech, displacing oral from some areas of dialogue, acquires a kind of orality. (4) There are different ways of revitalizing written speech, giving it orality. (5) Actually, this is what its current changes consist of. (7) I think not. (8) I think that, of course, there are people who completely go to the Internet, and this is not normal. (9) But for many it is salvation, because there are people who are still not adapted for oral communication, who are too shy. (10) And here they may well feel confident; someone is lonely, but on the Internet you can always find an interlocutor. (11) And what is significant: the Russian language, as we know, came out on the Internet, took the second place. (12) In fact, it goes on a par with the German language, lagging very far behind English, but nevertheless ... (13) And the more the Russian language is present on the Internet, the more it experiences the pressure of the new conditions of communication ... (14) But I think the younger generation is finding some sort of reasonable balance. (15) Of course, if we look at, say, fifty and twenty, we see that their relationship to social networks is different. (16) For a fifty-year-old or sixty-year-old, there is a question: to start functioning on social networks or not to start? (17) But for a twenty-year-old, this question, in principle, is not. (18) That is, he will be a black sheep if he does not start. (19) So in that sense, the world has changed. (20) There is more written speech, it has become more oral, but still people are not numb, just the existing balance has been slightly disturbed - it is unusual for us, but so far, it seems to me, there is no way back.

(15) Gradually, leaves flew from its branches, first from the upper ones, then from the lower ones. (16) The leaves streamed in streams, covering the balcony, and some stuck to the glass and looked in horror into the room, expecting something.

(3) Leaving her was unthinkable: in the first blizzard, upon falling, she would have crushed Kalinov's gatehouse like a rotten nut. (4) - Now sound a little, - Knyshev said in a dull voice. (5) - Dakos and me to warm up a bit! (6) Unexpectedly for everyone, he threw off his underwear and remained in a white shirt, belted with a Caucasian strap with a silver set. (7) A dozen hands extended the saws to him; he chose an ax from the nearest one, estimated the weight, approvingly, for trial, touched the blade with his fingernail, which rang like a string, and trampled on the snow where it interfered - listened to the upper rustle of the forest and slowly, as on a scaffold, looked at his sacrifice. (8) She was incredibly good now, the old mother of Oblog, in her ancient beauty, straight as a ray, and without a single flaw; snow, like a pink dream, rested on her heavy branches. (9) While not yet in full force, Knyshev swung and, with a pull on himself, as if teasing, hit the very bottom, on the resinous flow at the butt, where, like veins, the roots ran up the trunk, and the boy Ivan almost gasped from surprise that the blood did not splash his hands. (10) - Here's how to get it, - said Zolotukhin instructively. (11) - Learn! (12) And although Knyshev acted without a break, everyone understood: he somewhat tightens up his pleasure, which ordinary people never forgave even to the real executioners. (13) - Come on ... - someone whispered stiflingly above Ivan's head. (14) A barely noticeable movement was born in the branches, something busily crunched below and a small tremor echoed in the top. (15) There is nothing slower and more agonizing on earth than the fall of a tree, under whose shade the vague dreams of childhood visited you! (16) Without waiting for the end, all shuddering, Ivan went to wander through the open space. (17) He returned when he passed the fit of despair. (18) It is not clear, after so many years, where the quiet peasant youth got such rage from, but one thing should be admitted to understand everything further: a vocation from a young age leads a person through skillfully selected spectacles of life in order to educate in him the skill and will to realize his historical goals. (19) One can only guess what a miracle Ivan had a slingshot, who put a stone in his hand in the middle of winter.

(3) There is nothing slower and more agonizing on earth than the fall of a tree, under whose shade the vague dreams of childhood visited you! (4) Without waiting for the end, all shuddering, Ivan went to wander through the open space. (5) He returned when the fit of despair was over. (6) It is not clear, after so many years, where the quiet peasant youth got such rage from, but one thing should be admitted to understand everything further: a vocation from a young age guides a person through skillfully selected spectacles of life in order to educate in him the skill and will to realize his historical goals. (7) One can only guess what a miracle Ivan had a slingshot, who put a stone in his hand in the middle of winter. (8) Knyshev managed to release the first cloud of smoke when Ivanov's gift hit him on the cheek. (9) There was confusion, foul language broke out. (10) Knyshev's assistant Titka, who arrived in time, rushed with a dog at the offender, who set off to the forest on virgin snow. (11) It was easier for the young man to jump over the rubble, but on one of them Ivan's felt boot jumped off, and he ripped his leg open with all his might on a branch hidden under a snowdrift. (12) Already no more than a dozen steps separated them, and Ivan - the future professor Vikhrov - would have walked with a torn ear if it hadn't turned up that saving birch birch at a gentle angle. (13) The boy immediately ran up to the fork and sat there, as if in a saddle, bared his teeth, terrible in his childish anger, and Titka walked downstairs, licked the snow from his palm with a long tongue, threatened him with his finger, until Knyshev himself arrived in time with all his equipment. - (14) Get down, little wolf, - the big one said dully, barely catching his breath. - (15) Rotten master! - repeated the little one, as if he knew that for Knyshev, who was proud of his health and plebeian origin, there was no offensive nickname. (16) Then Titka got down to business: - Pokaraul him, now we will knock him off with a pole! (17) Knyshev shyly looked at the boy, at his sparkling eyes under the torn tree, at his barefoot, bloody, slightly blue foot. (18) Something has changed in his intentions: he hardly regretted the human animal in rags, but he was probably amazed that for a whole decade of his villainous activity, only this one, in all of Russia, a peasant boy with fists stood up for the Russian forests. - (19) Get out of here, you fool!

(9)Для того чтобы поддержать в себе это приятное чувство, они постоянно в самых изящных выражениях говорят о своей любви как самому предмету, так и всем тем, кому даже и нет до этой любви никакого дела. (10)Для людей, которые так любят, любимый предмет любезен настолько, насколько он возбуждает то приятное чувство, сознанием и выражением которого они наслаждаются. (11)Второго рода любовь – любовь самоотверженная, она заключается в любви к процессу жертвования собой для любимого предмета, при этом не обращается внимание на то, хуже или лучше от этих жертв любимому предмету. (12)Люди, любящие так, никогда не верят взаимности. (13)Им всё равно, хорошо ли вы ели, хорошо ли спали, весело ли вам, здоровы ли вы, и они ничего не сделают, чтоб доставить вам эти удобства, ежели они в их власти. (14)Но стать под пулю, броситься в воду, в огонь, зачахнуть от любви – на это они всегда готовы, ежели только встретится случай. (15)Кроме того, люди, склонные к любви самоотверженной, бывают всегда горды своею любовью, взыскательны, ревнивы, недоверчивы и, странно сказать, желают своим предметам опасностей, чтоб избавлять от них, несчастий, чтоб утешать, и даже пороков, чтоб исправлять от них. (16)Третий род – любовь деятельная, она заключается в стремлении удовлетворять все нужды, все желания, прихоти, даже пороки любимого существа. (17)Люди, которые любят так, любят на всю жизнь. (18)Любовь их редко выражается словами, и если выражается, то не только не самодовольно, красиво, но и стыдливо, неловко, потому что они всегда боятся, что любят недостаточно… (19) И вот эта-то деятельная любовь к своему племяннику, племяннице, к сестре светилась в глазах, в каждом слове и движении Софьи Ивановны. (20)Только годы спустя я оценил вполне Софью Ивановну, но и тогда мне пришёл в голову вопрос: почему Дмитрий, старавшийся понимать любовь совершенно иначе, чем обыкновенно молодые люди, и имевший всегда перед глазами милую, любящую Софью Ивановну, вдруг страстно полюбил непонятную Любовь Сергеевну и только допускал, что в его тётке есть тоже хорошие качества.

(3) Tens of thousands of manor houses with their parks and pond systems also contributed to the country's landscape and landscape. (4) But, of course, first of all, and small villages and villages with willows, wells, sheds, bathhouses, paths, orchards, vegetable gardens, pledges, spinners, carved platbands, skates, porches, fairs, sundresses, round dances, mowing, shepherd's horns, sickles, flails, thatched roofs, small individual fields, plowing horses ...
